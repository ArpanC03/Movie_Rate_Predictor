## Task Objectives

This project aims to predict the rating of Indian movies listed on IMDb based on features like genre, director, actors, year of release, duration, and number of votes.

## Steps to Run the Project

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/# IMDb Movie Rating Prediction

## Task Objectives

This project aims to predict the rating of Indian movies listed on IMDb based on features like genre, director, actors, year of release, duration, and number of votes.

## Steps to Run the Project

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git`
2. Open the `movie_rating_prediction.ipynb` notebook in Google Colab.
3. Install the necessary libraries: `!pip install pandas numpy seaborn matplotlib scikit-learn tensorflow`
4. Run all the cells in the notebook to train the model and make predictions.

## Dataset

The project uses the "IMDb Movies India.csv" dataset, which can be found in the `data` folder.

## Model

The prediction model is a neural network built using TensorFlow and Keras.

## Evaluation

The model's performance is evaluated using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared (R²).# IMDb Movie Rating Prediction
