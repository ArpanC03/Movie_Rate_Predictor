STEPS TO RUN MY PROJECT

Step 1: Setting up the Environment

Open Google Colab: Navigate to Google Colab in your web browser.
Create a New Notebook: Create a new Colab notebook.
Install Libraries: Run the following code snippet in a code cell to install the necessary libraries:
!pip install pandas numpy seaborn matplotlib scikit-learn tensorflow
Use code with caution
Step 2: Importing Libraries

Import Libraries: Add the following code cell to your notebook to import the required libraries:
import pandas as pd
    import numpy as np
    import seaborn as sns
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
    from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder, StandardScaler
    from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
    from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense
    from tensorflow.keras.optimizers import Adam
    from sklearn.metrics import mean_absolute_error, mean_squared_error, r2_score
Use code with caution
Step 3: Data Loading and Preprocessing

Upload Data: Upload the "IMDb Movies India.csv" file to your Colab environment. You can use the file upload feature in the Colab interface.
Load Data: Load the data into a pandas DataFrame:
file_path = "/content/IMDb Movies India.csv"  # Update with your file path
    df = pd.read_csv(file_path, encoding='ISO-8859-1')
Use code with caution
Data Cleaning: Execute the code cells provided in the project for data cleaning, handling missing values, and converting data types. This includes removing duplicates, dropping irrelevant columns, and handling missing values.
Feature Encoding: Encode categorical features (Genre, Director, Actors) using Label Encoding.
Step 4: Model Training

Data Splitting: Split the data into training and testing sets using train_test_split.
Feature Scaling: Scale numerical features using StandardScaler.
Model Building: Define the neural network model using Sequential and Dense layers from Keras.
Model Compilation: Compile the model specifying the optimizer, loss function, and evaluation metrics.
Model Training: Train the model using model.fit with the training data.
Step 5: Model Evaluation and Prediction

Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance on the test data using metrics like MAE, MSE, RMSE, and R² score.
Prediction: Make predictions on new data using model.predict.
Visualization: Visualize model performance using plots like training loss curves, actual vs. predicted ratings, and prediction errors.
Step 6 (Optional): Interactive Prediction

Run the widget code: Run the code cells that create and display the interactive widgets.
Input Values: Use the widgets to input movie details and click "Predict" to get the predicted rating.
Important Notes

Make sure the "IMDb Movies India.csv" file is uploaded to your Colab environment.
Replace placeholders like file paths with your actual values.
The steps and code snippets provided here assume you have the complete project code available in your Colab notebook.

Functionality

Task Implementation: The project successfully implements the core task of predicting movie ratings based on various features. It covers data loading, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction.
Functionality: The model is trained and makes predictions, showcasing the working functionality. The interactive widgets for input are functional.
Accuracy: The accuracy achieved may require further optimization, as indicated by the R² score and accuracy within the threshold. This aspect could be improved for enhanced functionality.

--------------------------------------------------------

Code Quality

Structure: The code is generally well-structured, with clear sections for data preprocessing, model building, training, and evaluation. Functions are used but could be further optimized for reusability and modularity.
Readability: The code is reasonably readable, with variable names and comments that aid understanding. Further enhancements to consistency and code style could improve readability.
Efficiency: While the code runs and produces results, efficiency could be optimized. For instance, consider using vectorized operations or more efficient data structures where possible to reduce execution time.

--------------------------------------------------------

Innovation & Creativity

Unique Features: The inclusion of interactive input widgets for movie prediction adds a user-friendly element to the project. It allows users to dynamically change input values and observe predicted ratings, enhancing engagement.
Optimizations: The project uses common techniques like Label Encoding and Standard Scaling for feature processing. Exploring more advanced techniques such as one-hot encoding or other feature engineering methods could enhance the model's performance and showcase creativity.

--------------------------------------------------------

Documentation

Clarity: The code includes comments that provide context to some extent. However, comprehensive documentation of the project setup, libraries, functions, and data source is missing. Clear documentation would make the project more accessible and self-explanatory.
Explanation: The code includes some explanations, but detailed insights into the rationale behind the data preprocessing, model selection, and evaluation metrics are limited. Including more documentation would enhance understanding and help users replicate and expand upon the work.
